  \begin{quote}\large
    You want to think about how you decompose your data structures, how
    you think about them globally.  [...]  If you were building a house,
    you'd start with a set of blueprints that give you a picture of what
    the whole house looks like.  You wouldn't start with a bunch of
    tiles and say. ``Well I'll put this tile down on the ground, and
    then I'll find a tile to go next to it.''  But all too many people
    try to build their parallel programs by creating the smallest
    possible tiles and then trying to have the structure of their code
    emerge from the chaos of all these little pieces.  You have to have
    an organizing principle if you're going to survive making your code
    parallel.
